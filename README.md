### Medium Article: [Visualizing my mood in during Masters in Galway, Ireland](https://medium.com/@swapsid_/visualizing-my-mood-in-during-masters-in-galway-ireland-9a8c8706fbe4)


#### About the data and visualizations:
This data was collected via logging in my mood each day on Pixels. You can download the data in JSON format, which I cleaned up, processed a bit, and converted into Excel. You can find the raw and processed data in the reference section. Also, the python notebook where I cleaned and pre-processed the data for visualizations. I performed all my visualizations using Tableau. You can find the workbook in the reference section.

#### About the data and visualizations:
This data was collected via logging in my mood each day on Pixels. You can download the data in JSON format, which I cleaned up, processed a bit, and converted into Excel. You can find the raw and processed data in the reference section. Also, the python notebook where I cleaned and pre-processed the data for visualizations. I performed all my visualizations using Tableau. You can find the workbook in the reference section.
